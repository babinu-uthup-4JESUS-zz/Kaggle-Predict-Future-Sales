## Overview

We have the following problem description from it's [corresponding kaggle competition link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview/description) :
>In this competition you will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. We are asking you to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month. By solving this competition you will be able to apply and enhance your data science skills.

## Data

All the information pasted in this section has been obtained from the [webpage showing data related information of the corresponding kaggle competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data)


### Data Description
 
You are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.

### File Descriptions

- [sales_train.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/sales_train.csv) - the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.

- [test.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/test.csv) - the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.

- [sample_submission.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/sample_submission.csv) - a sample submission file in the correct format.

- [items.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/items.csv) - supplemental information about the items/products.

- [item_categories.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/item_categories.csv) - supplemental information about the items categories.

- [shops.csv](https://github.com/babinu-uthup-4JESUS/Kaggle-Predict-Future-Sales/blob/master/input/shops.csv) - supplemental information about the shops.

### Data fields

- ID - an Id that represents a (Shop, Item) tuple within the test set
- shop_id - unique identifier of a shop
- item_id - unique identifier of a product
- item_category_id - unique identifier of item category
- item_cnt_day - number of products sold. You are predicting a monthly amount of this measure
- item_price - current price of an item
- date - date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- date_block_num - a consecutive month number, used for convenience. January 2013 is 0, February 2013 is 1,..., October 2015 is 33
- item_name - name of item
- shop_name - name of shop
- item_category_name - name of item category

## Approach

The page setup for an Aimeos web shop is easy if you import the [standard page tree for TYPO3 8.7/9.5](https://aimeos.org/docs/TYPO3/Install_Aimeos/Setup_pages#Download) into your TYPO3 installation.

### Data Analysis and Validation

* In Web::Page, root page (the one with the globe)
* Right click on the globe
* Move the cursor to "Branch actions"
* In the sub-menu, click on "Import from .t3d"

![Go to the import view](https://aimeos.org/docs/images/Aimeos-typo3-pages-menu.png)

### Upload the page tree file

* In the page import dialog
* Select the "Upload" tab (2nd one)
* Click on the "Select" dialog
* Choose the file you've downloaded
* Press the "Upload files" button

![Upload the page tree file](https://aimeos.org/docs/images/Aimeos-typo3-pages-upload.png)

### Import the uploaded page tree file

* In Import / Export view
* Select the uploaded file from the drop-down menu
* Click on the "Preview" button
* The pages that will be imported are shown below
* Click on the "Import" button that has appeared
* Confirm to import the pages

![Import the uploaded page tree file](https://aimeos.org/docs/images/Aimeos-typo3-pages-import.png)

Now you have a new page "Shop" in your page tree including all required sub-pages.
